# Styled Components css comparison

This is a simple demo that shows the difference between regular a component build with Styled Components and CSS.

In the project directory you can built the program with:
### `yarn install`
and start it with:
### `yarn start`

You will then be showed two components that look and behave the same, one is built with styled components and one is built with using CSS. Links to the medium-article about styled components as well as links to kodeworks.no are supplied in the websites header.
