# Styled Components css comparison

This is a simple demo that shows the difference between regular a component build with Styled Components and CSS.

In the project directory you can build the program with:
### `yarn install`
and start it with:
### `yarn start`

You will then be showed two components that look and behave the same, but one is build with styled components and one is built with using CSS. Links to the medium-article about styled components as well as links to kodeworks.no are supplied in the websites header.
